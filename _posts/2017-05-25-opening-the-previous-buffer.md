Have you ever accidentally opened a file you didn't intend to from
somewhere like the quick fix window? Vim handles buffers like a champ so
all you need to do is `ctrl-o` while in normal mode.

`ctrl-o` opens the previously open buffer so if you navigated to a file
during a spec run (that wasn't your actual spec file), you can easily
navigate back to where you were.
